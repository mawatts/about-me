    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a family man through and through. I have 2 daughters, which I know will lead me to an early grave, but I enjoy every waking moment with them. I also enjoy relaxing with friends and family whenever possible, so I guess that makes me a good ole' boy, as there is nothing better than sitting around the camp fire telling stories and jokes. I am all about enjoying life to its fullest and never take a single moment for granted.</p>
    <p>I love working with computers in almost every aspect and look forward to always learning something new, which makes learning Front-End Development and Programming a perfect fit for me.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I am from a small rural town in Southeaster Indiana. Honestly, there really is not much there and if you blink you will miss it. I have lived in multiple places due to my time in the Military and my favorite was Key West, FL. Currently, I am living and loving life near Charleston, SC.</p>
